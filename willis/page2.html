                    Hurricane Laura devastated vast parts of Southwest Louisiana leaving hundreds of thousands without power and causing extensive damage throughout the state. Hurricane Delta left another layer of damage in coastal Louisiana, where the storm made landfall only six weeks after Hurricane Laura. Laura and Delta are believed to have caused billions of dollars in damage across the state. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the rebuilding process begins from Hurricane Laura and Delta, so will the claims process for property damage. Unfortunately, many insurance companies fail to timely and fairly compensate victims from storm damage. Don’t navigate this process alone and become another uncompensated or undercompensated Hurricane Laura and/or Delta damaged victim.

                    Willis Law & Justice handles Hurricane Laura claims for individual property owners and business owners against insurance companies for a denied claim, a delayed claim, loss of use of home, business interruption, renter’s insurance claim, property damage, flood damage, and bad faith claim handling.

                <p>
                    No upfront fees will be charged to you. If we don’t collect on your behalf, no fees will be incurred. We also only get paid if we recover more money for a property owner or a business owner than an insurance company initially offered to pay for Hurricane Laura & Delta property damage.
